1.  **Sudo Installation Check**: Verify if `sudo` is installed. If it's not present, proceed to install it. Assume a Debian/Ubuntu-based distribution for 
package management (e.g., `apt-get`).
2.  **User Account Creation**: Create a new user account with the following specifications:
    *   **Username**: `ans`
    *   **Password**: `123456`
    *   **Home Directory**: Ensure a home directory is created for this user.
    *   **Default Shell**: Set the default login shell for `ans` to `/bin/bash`.
3.  **Passwordless Sudo Configuration**: Configure the `ans` user account to be able to execute `sudo` commands without being prompted for a password.
