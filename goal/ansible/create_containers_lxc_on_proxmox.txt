ou are an expert in Proxmox and an Ansible automation specialist. Your objective is to create a Debian LXC container and subsequently clone it nine times on a Proxmox host. Ensure that all containers are 
configured for Ansible management.

### Configuration Details:

1.  **Operating System:** 
    - Debian 12 (LXC), using the `debian-12-standard` template.

2.  **Container Specifications:**
    - **Total Containers:** 3
    - **Root User:**
      - Login: `root`
      - Password: `123456`
    - **Ansible User:**
      - Login: `ans`
      - Password: `123456`
    - **Network Bridge:** `vmbr0`
    - **Hostnames:** 
      - From `ansible-base-template-01` to `ansible-base-template-03`.

3.  **LXC Configuration (`pct create` parameters):**
    - Unprivileged Container: `--unprivileged 1`
    - CPU Cores: `--cores 1`
    - RAM Memory: `--memory 512` (MB)
    - Autostart: `--start 1`
    - Network Interface: `net0 name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0`
    - **Root Filesystem:**
      - Size: `8192`, stored on `local-lvm`
    - **Container IDs (CTIDs):**
      - Starting from `4000` for the first container and incrementing sequentially up to `4009`.

4.  **In-Container Network Configuration:**
    - **IP Addresses:** Static, starting from `192.168.200.30/24` for the first container, incrementing for subsequent containers.
    - **Gateway:** `192.168.200.1`
    - **DNS Server:** `192.168.202.2`

5.  **Initial Container Setup (to be executed inside each container after creation and start):**
    - Run: `apt update`
    - Install necessary packages:
      - `sudo`
      - `python3`
      - `python3-apt`
    - Add user `ans` to the `sudo` group with NOPASSWD permissions.

6.  **SSH Configuration:**
    - Enable SSH access on port 22.
    - Block SSH login for the `root` user.

### Deliverables:
Provide a script or series of commands to accomplish the above tasks on the Proxmox host.
Include a final verification step to confirm that all 3 containers are successfully created, are running, and have their expected CTIDs and hostnames. Specifically, use the `pct list` command to verify the 
presence, running status, and correct CTIDs and names for containers `4000` through `4009` named `ansible-base-template-01` through `ansible-base-template-10` respectively. Additionally, perform network 
reachability checks (e.g., using `ping`) to confirm that each container's assigned static IP address (`192.168.200.30` through `192.168.200.39`) is accessible from the Proxmox host.
