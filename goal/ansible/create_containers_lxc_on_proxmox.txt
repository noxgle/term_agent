You are a Proxmox expert and an Ansible automation specialist. Your task is to create 10 Debian LXC containers on a Proxmox host. These containers should be configured to be ready for Ansible management.

Detailed configuration for each container:
* **Operating System:** Debian 12 (LXC), based on the `debian-12-standard` template.
* **Number of containers:** 10
* **Root user:** login `root`, password `123456`
* **Ansible user:**
 * login `ans`, password `123456`
 * User `ans` should be added to the `sudo` group and have permissions to execute `sudo` commands without a password (NOPASSWD).
* **Network bridge:** `vmbr0`
* **Hostnames:** From `ansible-base-template-01` to `ansible-base-template-10`.
* **LXC configuration (`pct create` parameters):**
 * Unprivileged container: `--unprivileged 1`
 * CPU cores: `--cores 1`
 * RAM memory: `--memory 512` (MB)
 * Autostart: `--start 1`
 * Network interface: `net0 name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0`
 * **Root Filesystem:** Size `8G`, stored on `local-lvm` (e.g., `--rootfs local-lvm:8G`).
 * **Container IDs (CTIDs):** Starting from `4000` for the first container (`ansible-base-template-01`), and incrementing sequentially up to `4009` for the tenth container (`ansible-base-template-10`).
* **In-container network configuration:**
 * IP addresses: Static, starting from `192.168.200.30/24` for the first container, then sequentially for subsequent ones.
 * Gateway: `192.168.200.1`
 * DNS server: `192.168.202.2`
* **In-container SSH configuration:**
 * SSH access should be available on the standard port 22.
 * SSH login for the `root` user should be blocked.

**Expected output:** A complete Bash script that step-by-step implements the above requirements on the Proxmox host, including creating containers, network configuration, setting up users and their permissions 
(including sudo NOPASSWD for 'ans' user), and SSH configuration.

**Script details:**
* The script should NOT be idempotent (it does not need to check for existing containers or users).
* The script should primarily use Proxmox CLI tools (e.g., `pct create`, `pct exec`, `pvesh`).
* The script should include basic error handling (e.g., checking command exit codes).
