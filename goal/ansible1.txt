You are an AI agent tasked with generating Ansible playbooks. The user wants to install a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP) stack on hosts with IP addresses ranging from 10.10.10.1 to 10.10.10.254. The hosts are Debian/Ubuntu systems. The playbook and related files should be created within a project 
directory named `ans1` located in `/tmp`. The playbook should:

1. Create a project directory `/tmp/ans1`.
2.  Create a `hosts` file within the project directory containing the IP address range. Use an Ansible inventory range expression if possible.
3.  Create a `lamp.yml` playbook within the project directory that will:
    *   Update the apt cache.
    *   Install Apache2.
    *   Enable the Apache2 `rewrite` module.
    *   Install the MariaDB server.
    *   Install PHP and the `libapache2-mod-php` and `php-mysql` modules.
    *   Set the MariaDB root password to `YourNewPassword` (replace this with a variable that the user can easily modify. Comment the line instructing the user to change it to a strong secure password).
    *   Secure the MariaDB installation by removing the `mysql` database and anonymous users.
    *   Restart Apache2 after enabling the `rewrite` module.

Generate the necessary files with their content. Include comments explaining each task in the `lamp.yml` file. Include security considerations. Emphasize in the comments in `lamp.yml`  the need to change the MariaDB root password to a strong, secure password.
